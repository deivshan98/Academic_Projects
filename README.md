# Academic_Projects
These are a few of my academic projects where I had to use Python and regression analysis on varied datasets. 
The one excel file was from a Portfolio Theory class, and includes work with a few models and analysis. 
The one SAS file is from my Computational Statistics class, and is a simple final project that I completed.
